# Master-s-Thesis: The analysis of biomedical signals while playing the logic games

The aim of the study is to investigate changes in biomedical signals such as facial surface temperature distribution (IR thermography), EEG, EKG, or GRS signals during playing logical games such as bridge or chess. The task of the diploma student is to develop a biometric profile of the individual and examine changes in this profile during increased mental activity. In addition, the study will explore the application of AI/ML algorithms to analyze the obtained signals. These algorithms will enable the extraction of meaningful patterns and insights from the complex biomedical data, aiding in the identification of correlations between cognitive activity and physiological responses.
